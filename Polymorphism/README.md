# Polymorphism

Poly- Many. \
Morph- Changing into different form.

Example: A man is a

- Father
- Brother
- Husband
- Son

There are two types of Polymorphism:

- Compile Time
  - Function Overloading
  - Operator Overloading
- Runtime

### Function Overloading

Function with same name with different return type might not work. Change in input Argument is needed.

### Operator Overloading

Change the function of any operator.

syntax: Use operator word as prefix and operator sign as suffix

```c++
void operator%(){// Define the function of operator here.
}
```

### Runtime Polymorphism

Method Overidding

### Abstraction

Implementation Hiding

- Using classes
- Using header files
- Using access modifiers
